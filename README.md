### Hi there 👋, my name is Axio
#### Up-skilling myself! Always learning!

I'm Axio from the UK.
I am currently learning the fundamentals of multiple platforms/languages, mostly revolving around python and related back-end languages, with plans to also gain a solid grasp of java-script in the near future.
 
I am very driven and my goal is to be employed in the tech industry within the next 8-12 months.
I am currently working on basic coding projects in my spare time outside of my fulltime job, as well as systematically working through and completing creditable learning platform programs, such as Microsoft learn.

I will be adding all of my projects, certificates and achievement's to my Github profile.
