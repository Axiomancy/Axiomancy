### Hi there 👋, my name is Axio
#### Up-skilling myself! Always learning!

I'm Axio from the UK.
I am currently learning the fundamentals of multiple platforms/languages, mostly revolving around python and related back-end languages, with plans to also gain a solid grasp of java-script in the near future.

I will be adding all of my projects, certificates and achievement's to my Github profile.
